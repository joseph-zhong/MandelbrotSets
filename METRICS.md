## Background

## Objectives

The goal of this project was to discover the use case of dynamic parallelism.
Specifically, we take a simple sequential and naive per-pixel algorithm and
apply specific modifications to more efficiently utilize resources, quickly
exiting when possible, leaving more resources for computationally expensive
portions of our problem as we dynamically discover them.

## Measured Experiments

- Pixels/Time
- Time/Resolution
- Time/Iterations
